Design/development highlights

- Using GSAP to provide animations on welcome screen as well use making windows draggable like a real MacOS
- Proper software development practices such as using a higher order component called a WindowWrapper to wrap all window position/close behavior so that the child windows are not aware

- Leveraging ability to use react=pdf to allow for downloadble actual pdf file for resume
